# Table of contents

You can use the `Toc` component to generate a table of contents for your slides:

<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="1" />

The title will be inferred from your slide content, or you can override it with `title` and `level` in your frontmatter.

<Toc text-sm minDepth="1" maxDepth="2" />

# Week 1 Month 1

In the First Week we discussed about using Learning How To Learn, Frontend HandBook and Refactoring UI Book
#### Learning How To Learn

Learning how to learn means improving your ability to acquire and retain knowledge by understanding how your mind works. It involves: Metacognition: Being aware of and managing your learning strategies, Effective Techniques: Using spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving, and elaboration, Strategy Over Style: Choosing the right method for the material, not relying on learning "styles.", Feedback & Reflection: Regularly assessing and adjusting your approach, Environment & Motivation: Staying focused with clear goals and a good setup.

It’s about learning smarter, not just harder.

Would you like a visual cheat sheet of these principles?

# Frontend HandBook

The Frontend Handbook is a guide that outlines best practices, tools, and knowledge areas for frontend developers. It serves as a roadmap for learning and improving in frontend development.

Key Components:
Foundational Skills: Covers HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the core of frontend.

Frameworks & Libraries: Introduces tools like React, Vue, or Angular.

Tooling: Explains bundlers (Webpack, Vite), package managers, version control (Git), etc.

Performance & Accessibility: Emphasizes speed and inclusive design.

Architecture & Design Patterns: Guides you in building scalable, maintainable codebases.

Testing & Deployment: Covers how to test code and ship to production.

Career & Collaboration: Offers advice on working in teams, communication, and job roles.

It’s like a map for becoming a competent frontend developer—from beginner to advanced.

# Refactoring UI

Refactoring UI is a design guide by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger that teaches developers how to create beautiful, usable interfaces—without needing to be a designer.

Core Ideas:
Design isn’t just about visuals—it's about clarity, hierarchy, and usability.

Small tweaks = big impact: Improving spacing, alignment, contrast, and typography can transform a UI.

Start with structure: Get layout and content right before worrying about colors or details.

Use systems: Consistent spacing, font sizes, and color scales make design easier and better.

Refactor like code: Improve UI in iterations, just like refactoring messy code.

Key Topics:
Visual hierarchy,
Spacing and layout,
Color usage and contrast,
Typography,
Reusable design patterns,
Real-world before/after UI makeovers

It’s especially useful for developers who want to level up their UI instincts without formal design training.

# Functions

- Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. 
- They allow you to write cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code.

Function Declaration
<div grid="~ cols- gap-2" m="t-2">

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!
```
```js
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
console.log(calculateArea(5, 10)); // 50
```
Explanation:
- function calculateArea(...) is a function declaration.
- It takes two parameters: width and height.
- It returns the area by multiplying them.
You can call it anywhere after (or even before) the declaration thanks to hoisting.

# Function Expression
```js
let functionName = function (parameters) {
  //function body
}
```
```js
const add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```
```js
const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};
console.log(greet("Liam")); // Hello, Liam
```

---

# Arrow Function

```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20
```
```js
const createUser = (name, age) => ({
  name: name,
  age: age,
});

console.log(createUser("Alice", 30));
// { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
```
 Default Parameters
```js
function sayHello(name = "Guest") {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
console.log(sayHello()); // Hello, Guest
```
```js
function makeGreeting(name, message = `Hi ${name}, welcome!`) {
  return message;
}

console.log(makeGreeting("John")); // Hi John, welcome!
```
---

# Rest Parameters
```js
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
```
```js
function findMax(...numbers) {
  return Math.max(...numbers);
}
console.log(findMax(3, 7, 2, 9, 5)); // 9
```
CallBack Function
```js
function processUserInput(callback) {
  const name = "Jane";
  callback(name);
}
processUserInput((name) => console.log(`Hi, ${name}`)); // Hi, Jane
```

---

# contd on CallBack Function
```js
function processArray(arr, callback) {
  arr.forEach(callback);
}

function printElement(element) {
  console.log(element);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
processArray(numbers, printElement);
// Output:
// 
```

# Immediately invoked Function Expression
```js
(function() {
  console.log("This runs immediately!");
})(); // This runs immediately!
```

  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
})("Alice");
```
Immediately invoked Function Expression assigned to a variable
```js
const result = (function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
})(5, 3);

console.log(result); // 8
